# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Overview
This repository contains a series of Markdown files (`hw0.md` to `hw5.md`) and image assets. It appears to be focused on documentation, assignments, or a knowledge base, rather than a traditional codebase with build/test workflows.

## Key Files & Structure
- `hw0.md` to `hw5.md`: Main content files. Each file likely represents a separate assignment, chapter, or module. Review these files for project-specific conventions and recurring patterns.
- `image.png`, `image-1.png`: Image assets referenced in Markdown files. Ensure correct relative paths when linking images.

## Patterns & Conventions
- All content is in Markdown format. Use standard Markdown syntax for headings, lists, code blocks, and image embedding (`![alt text](image.png)`).
- If updating or adding assignments, follow the structure and formatting style found in existing `hw*.md` files.
- Images should be placed in the root directory and referenced with relative paths (e.g., `![Diagram](image.png)`).

## Developer Workflows
- No build, test, or debug commands are present. Changes are made directly to Markdown files.
- No external dependencies or integration points detected.
- Version control is managed via Git. Use standard Git workflows for commits and pushes.

## AI Agent Guidance
- When generating new content, match the tone, structure, and formatting of existing Markdown files.
- For updates, preserve the original style and intent of each assignment or documentation section.
- If adding new images, ensure filenames are unique and update references in Markdown accordingly.
- Avoid introducing code or automation unless explicitly requested.

## Example: Adding a New Assignment
1. Create a new file `hw6.md` in the root directory.
2. Use the same heading and section style as previous `hw*.md` files.
3. Reference images using relative paths if needed.
